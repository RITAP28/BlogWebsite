## Notes:
1. Introduce the hybrid system of accounts. If the user tries to sign in via google account, then the google should turn to true. If the user tries to sign in via normal method, then the other one will turn to true. Initially, both will be false.
2. Current User will store the details of the sign up process. Username, password and email.



## Issues:
1. LoggedUser in Navbar.jsx is logged in the console as null, null and then the actual information about the user.
2. In the Profile page, posts of the user are not being displayed.
